1. need to update count for every cached reaction ✔
2. reposting should immediately update emoji reactions ✔
3. new reactions aren't inserted into the db when the repost has already happened ✔
4. reaction ticks up on duplicate reactions
5. when caching reactions, if a cached reaction exists then old reactions of that same emoji won't be cached
	- updating the count column also fails in this scenario
